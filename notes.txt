this is my problem statement "Course Completion and Learning Path Optimization"

Overview:
Develop a module that monitors employee progress in learning paths and course completions

Design & Build:

- Build course progress dashboards for employees to track their current enrollments, completion rates, and certificates.

- Create admin interfaces to manage learning paths and assign courses to employees.

- Build interactive learning path suggestions based on employee performance.

- Create database tables to store course metadata (title, duration, difficulty level), completion status, and performance metrics."


and for the data science part Learning Path Optimization: Use machine learning to recommend optimal learning paths for employees, identifying which courses lead to the highest performance improvements or quickest learning outcomes.
